# janitor

Scans your janet projects to check for uncommitted files, unpushed commits, broken tests, and JPM deps that are out of date or incomplete.

## Usage

`janitor scan <dir>` to scan an individual directory
`janitor scan-dirs` to scan all of the subdirectories of the current directory, provided they have a project.janet
